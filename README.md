# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This my personal solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in `typescript`, ran via `vitest`.

## Getting Started

This project uses [volta](https://volta.sh) as the node version manager, ran against node 18 and npm 9

```sh
# install typescript and vitest (and node types)
npm ci

# runs the solutions
npm test 
```
